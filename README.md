# Parking Management System

## Overview

The Parking Management System is a C# Windows Forms application designed to streamline the process of managing parking slots, vehicles, and bookings. This system provides a user-friendly interface for parking attendants or administrators to add vehicles, book parking slots, and retrieve data efficiently. It is built using the Guna UI framework for a modern and polished frontend experience, backed by a robust .NET backend. The data is stored and managed using a MySQL database.

- **Retrieve Data**: View and manage vehicle and booking records through an integrated data grid. Users can update or delete records, ensuring that the database remains current.

- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality that ensures only authorized users can access and modify the systemâ€™s data.
